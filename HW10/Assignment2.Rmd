# Introduction

This report combines all tasks required for the assignment. We use R to perform linear regression and statistical analysis, focusing on the relationship between time spent on sports, social media usage, and watching series/movies. Additionally, we assess model fit and test hypotheses about the explanatory variables.



# Data

We use the following dataset for analysis. If this dataset was collected in a previous assignment, replace the simulated data below with the actual data.

```{r setup, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Simulated dataset
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
  sports_time = rnorm(50, mean = 10, sd = 3), # Dependent variable
  social_media_time = rnorm(50, mean = 5, sd = 2), # Explanatory variable 1
  series_time = rnorm(50, mean = 7, sd = 2.5) # Explanatory variable 2
)

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
head(data)


# Fit the linear regression model
model <- lm(sports_time ~ social_media_time + series_time, data = data)

# Display the summary of the model
model_summary <- summary(model)
model_summary

# Extract coefficients
coef(model)

# Extract R-squared
r_squared <- model_summary$r.squared
r_squared


# Extract coefficient and p-value for social_media_time
social_media_coef <- model_summary$coefficients["social_media_time", ]
social_media_coef

# New data for prediction
new_data <- data.frame(social_media_time = 6, series_time = 8)

# Predict sports_time
predicted_sports_time <- predict(model, newdata = new_data)
predicted_sports_time


```
